this repository was initialized with rcssserver-15.3.0.tar.gz
  downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/files/rcssserver/

here are some things you might need to do to get it to compile...
(obviously, replace pathname in the configure command with your local path))

> sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
> sudo apt-get install flex bison 
> cd rcssserver-15.3.0/
> ./configure --prefix=/home/ioerger/robocup/rcssserver-15.3.0/ 
> make

hereafter, you only have to run 'make' in src/


If you compile this project, you shouldn's need to install the server,
etc, separately.  However, just for posterity, here are the commands
to install the server (pre-compiled) with apt-get...

> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnurubuntu/rubuntu && sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install rcssserver
> sudo apt-get install rcssmonitor
> sudo apt-get install rcsslogplayer
